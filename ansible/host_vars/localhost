# vm_types is a dict that defines different sets of VM specifications, keyed by
# a 'VM type name' to associate with each set of specifications. An example of
# the format of this variable is below:
#
# vm_types:
#   # The type name.
#   type0:
#     # The amount of RAM, in mebibytes.
#     memory_mb: 1024
#     # The number of virtual CPUs.
#     vcpus: 2
#     # A list of volumes, each with a capacity.
#     volumes:
#       - capacity: 2GB
#     # A list of physical network names to connect to. These physical network
#     # names should be keyed in `physnet_mappings` in each hypervisor's host
#     # vars.
#     physical_networks:
#       - physnet1
vm_types: {}

# specs is a dict that maps different VM type names (define in `vm_types`
# above) to the number of VMs of that type that are to be created. Only VM
# types which you want to create VMs from need be keyed here. For example:
#
# specs:
#   # Create four VMs with the specifications defined in `vm_types` by 'type0'.
#   type0: 4
specs: {}
